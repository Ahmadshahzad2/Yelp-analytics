      "full": "This is the first time I have ever tried Afghanistan cuisine and it was mind blowing. The blend of spices, textures, and flavors created a unique and satisfying dining experience that left me craving more. The service was amazing and the staff were extremely knowledgeable about the menu and eager to share information about the cultural origins of each dish.\n\nfor starter we had their seasonal off the menu Brussel sprouts, egg plant dip and Bolani. The Brussel sprouts were cooked to perfection, with a crispy exterior and a tender, flavorful interior. I would rate it (3.5/5).\n\nEgg plant dip (4/5) amazing. Packed with flavor and goes really well with their flatbread.\n\nBolani (5/5) is a traditional Afghanistan street food. The way the restaurant prepared it was truly exceptional.\n\nFor the main course we had Slow Cooked Lamb Shoulder & Seven Spice Roast Half Chicken & Uzbeki Palaw. The lamb was so tender that it fell off the bone with just a fork, and the spices had permeated the meat, creating a depth of flavor that was simply incredible. When you pair it with Uzbeki Palaw it was heaven! The combination was just perfection. (5/5) The Roast Chicken also (5/5) it was cooked to perfection. It was so moist and packed with flavor that you cant stop wanting to have the next bite.\n\nI have been raving about this restaurant to my family and friends and I would definitely come back again! because the amount of care they put towards their food I understand why when you make a reservation they ask for $50 deposit per person in case you don't show up.",

      "full": "Ah, what a wonderful meal. Was very easy to make a reservation online ahead of time. Service was prompt and attentive. \n- Bamyan ($10) - amazing mocktail. Loved the mango melona popsicle. Really tasted like a mango lassi. \n- Pakawra ($19) - loved how crispy this was. Chutney was so refreshing and flavourful. \n- Oyster mushroom kebab ($23) - wow so flavourful for a gluten free dish. Mushrooms were amazing on its own with a beautiful char. \n- Lamb shoulder ($46) - delicious and fell off the bone. I personally loved the eggplant and pickled cabbage. The pickled eggplant and cauliflower was a little too sour for my taste. \n- Uzbeki palaw ($26) - it was just okay. Felt like we needed a carb with the lamb shoulder and this was recommended to us. Lamb felt overcooked and the rice wasn't as flavourful as I expected. Would get the challow or naan next time. \n- Milk pudding ($9) - loved the texture and cardamom spice in this. Very shareable as it's quite filling.",

As good as the food is, I must also give kudos for their drinks. They have a really unique list of drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic). Additionally, they switch up the menu every so often so there's a good chance you'll be trying new things. \n\nThe service is so good. Everyone is so nice and hospitable. The staff are warm and welcoming and they really know their stuff! When I come here in big groups, I often look to the staff for portion recommendations and pairings. \n\nThe ambiance of the place is amazing. The place has a lot of windows so the natural light influences the vibe of the place. In the winter time, it's a bit darker and more intimate. In the summer, sunshine comes through and it's light and bright (a more airy sense of space). \n\nHighly recommend a reservation in advance (as much as possible) as this place is ALWAYS busy. It'll be hard to get a walk in for dinner time. I've never gone without a reservation.",

Although the traffic can be quite loud since it faces main street. \n\nI ordered the mango matcha. At $10 it was definitely a treat, but I had been craving a good matcha for a long time. I will say the size of the drink was quite large and there were a decent amount of mango chunks. I think for a drink like this, I would have preferred a mix of mango puree and chunks. It was hard to drink with the straw since it was a paper straw and it became limp before I could finish the drink. Understandable they're trying to be eco friendly. I ended up just drinking the rest without a straw. \n\nAs for the food, I had the kebab and egg skillet. The portion was quite large. It had large chunks of beef, plenty of potatoes, two poached eggs and bread. Flavours were on point. The beef was a tad dry but with the spiced yogurt it was good. Service was attentive and friendly. Overall it was a solid brunch meal.",

      "full": "This is one of the must stop restaurants when I have family or friends in town and one of the places happy to be on repeat. We started with A Camel Named Gerald and Dr Damji's Negroni cocktails as celebrating milestone birthdays. I am not a Negroni fan but my friend is and the presentation of the Negroni was great with the infused smoke. My cocktail had my favs mezcal, tequila, rosewater and hazelnut in a delicious concoction, tad on the sweeter side but based on the ingredients, my endless love for mezcal was worth a $20 cocktail. We started with the beets & burrata salad which was pretty good, nice start to our early dinner before our musical at the Stanley. Then we had coconut fish dumplings in a tumeric base which were very good and my favorite of the evening but we never got a clear response from our waitress on what was the white fish as she said she would check and let us know and never did, as she thought it was cod but another waiter that brought our next course said it was halibut. Unfortunately our last course was a disappointment as our waitress recommended the lamb shoulder but it was our least favorite of the evening and wish I had ordered the leg of lamb again as I described how it falls off the bone but the lamb shoulder was overcooked and tougher to enjoy. Would be keen to try them for happy hour as hoping it is better for value while they still have it during the week as their prices have gone up substantially.",

Server and bartender both super friendly and helpful with the menu. \n\nWe were recommended 3 dishes among 2 ppl to share. This was the perfect amount. \n\nWe ordered:\nThe vegetarian \"meatballs\". Spicy and tasty but a little too salty for us. \nBeef mantu dumplings- comes with 4 pcs and they're big. These were excellent. \nLamb shank. Server recommended the rice side with it so we got it too. Excellent combo, easy recommend. \n\nDessert: we shared a milk pudding. Also delicious but somewhat heavy. Think panna cotta but thicker and heavier. \n\nWe finished all this food between 2 of us and were super stuffed. \n\nRestaurant is on the small side but nice decor. Bar stools not super comfortable but fine. Ambience is pretty chill. Not too noisy. They have a small outdoor patio too. \n\nWe shared the medjool date non-alcoholic \"cocktail\" which was interesting. They have a sizeable cocktail menu but it's quite pricey. \n\nMetered parking on the street and there's a pay lot behind the building. \n\nDespite my minor gripes, this is a 5/5 for me. Good food, service, nice venue, would come back for sure.",

Amazing service (the owner greeted each table and check in periodically despite how busy the place was) with great warm and airy ambiance. Brunch was overall tasty and I would come back to try more dishes.\n\nFull Afghan ($29) plus chutney ($3) 7.5/10\nZarak's take on full english breakfast menu with lamb sausage, fried eggs, kidney bean curry, eggplant, and potato bread. Honestly I'm not a fan of sausage in general, so the lamb sausage was a bit lacklustre and gamey for me. The bean curry and eggplant were the highlight, especially eaten with the potato bread and chutney.\n\nKebab & Eggs Skillet ($25) 7.5/10\nJuicy beef with medium poached eggs. Potato was nicely crispy and the spiced yoghurt was strangely addicting. They also gave you two flatbreads, which we barely touched because how big the portions were.\n\nKarak Chai ($6) & Iced Latte ($6)\nOne thing I need to highlight about Zarak is that they have a variety of unique seasonal drinks. We got pretty basic coffee and chai (though the biscuit was quite tasty) but nowadays they have anything from strawberry matcha to pistachio latte.",

Their mantu dumplings were soooo good that we could have ordered more...\n\nButter cauliflower curry, chicken thigh kebab, seven spice half roast chicken, lamb shoulder, volcano, and Uzbeki palaw... we didn't leave any room at all for dessert. \n\nYou can't go wrong with any of their dishes so make sure you go with a group of family or friends to sample them all!\n\n\n#eatthewongway #foodporn #food #foodpic #foodie #foodphotography #delicious #nomnom #supportlocal#foodiesinternational #foodpics #foodphoto #foodart #foodiegram #foodielife #foodstagram #goodfood #vancouverfoodie #vancouverisawesome #vancouverfood",

      "full": "From the start to the end we enjoyed our anniversary at Zarak. We love the ambiance in there. Seating is nice, the decor is tasteful. Everything was perfect to be honest. The timing of food coming out from appetizers to entrees to dessert was within a good timeframe. We waited a few mins but not so long that we would be hungry. We were satiated between dishes. Needless to say we left with our bellies full, craving for more. I know! We are already planning our next meal there. Every single dish was full of flavour that it made me smile with every bite. You can't go wrong with any of their menu items. Just ask your server they can recommend choices that are to your taste palate. However, I will say the fish dumplings in the coconut tumeric broth was so good that I used the naan to sop up the broth. Their beets & burrata salad is massive, definitely one to share. It has a bit of spice kick to it but is cooled down by the burrata, beets & sweetness of the cranberries & pickled mulberries. We had the chicken kebab which was full of flavor and very tender, It was a nice dish to end it. But of course no dinner is complete without trying the desserts! We got the Shir Yakh which was a rosewater & cardamom gelato with crumbled pistachio in a creamy sauce, kind of like a lighter version of condense milk. It was pretty in pink & did not taste heavy or too sweet but enough to fulfill your dessert craving. We had a bit of a hiccup during our dinner but Gary (manager) dealt with the problem quickly and professionally. We didn't expect much as we were already happy with everything but Gary and Sanmeet still went above and beyond. We felt like regulars there even though it was our first time, but that's how their staff makes you feel...like family/friends. Highly recommend you go here for their dinner and brunch. Both experiences will leave you craving for more & will not disappoint!",

The Mantu was well seasoned and had a great balance of flavour. The lamb shank was perfectly cooked and everything on the plate balanced out the meal wonderfully. The bolani was crispy and delicious. The rose and cardamom ice cream was the perfect end to the meal, light and creamy. Our server, Fazl was so incredibly kind and talked us through the whole meal. Definitely some of the best service I've received. He made sure all our questions were answered, all our food was up to standard, and gave us personalized recommendations!! Can't wait to come back.",

I tried a few of the popular items here: brussel sprouts, lamb shank, mantu, and spicy chicken - they are well-loved, and for good reason! I also ordered the Band-e-Amir, a beautiful purple cocktail that was equally pretty as it was delicious.\nThe food was a bit spicy (especially the chicken), but it was done well, and without covering up/sacrificing flavour. Both the lamb shank and chicken were cooked until tender. Perfection! My favourite dish was the brussel sprouts.. I don't know what they did to make it so delicious, but it's a must order in my books.",
